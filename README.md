# Overview of tactics in Lean 4 for beginners (longer version)

In the following table, *name* always refers to a name already known to Lean
while *new_name* refers to a new name provided by the user;
*expr* designates an expression,
for example the name of an object in the context,
an arithmetic expression that is a function of such objects,
a hypothesis in the context,
or a lemma applied to any of these.
When one of these words appears twice in the same line,
the appearances do not designate the same name or
the same expression.
